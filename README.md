# Face Emotion Detection

A deep learning–based system for real-time facial emotion recognition using computer vision techniques.

## 📌 Overview
This project detects human emotions from facial expressions in real time using a webcam or images. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on facial expression datasets to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality.

## 🧠 Emotions Detected
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Surprise
- Neutral
- Fear 

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Gradio

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Face detection using OpenCV
2. Face preprocessing (grayscale, resizing)
3. CNN-based emotion classification
4. Real-time emotion display on video feed

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
python 3.8+
pip install -r requirements.txt
